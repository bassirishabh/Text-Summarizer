                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">THE SEVEN OLD SAMURAI</p>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">Once upon a time, in far off Japan, a band of fierce robbers had their
hiding place on top of a mountain almost always covered with grey clouds,
windswept and battered by storms. The robbers lived in a large cave where they
had piled their spoils. Now and again, they went down the mountain, attacked a
village, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could
lay hands on and burned it to the ground. Wherever the robbers passed, there
was nothing but smoking ruins, weeping men and women, misery, mournlng and
desolation.
   The Emperor, worried at this, had sent his soldiers to attack the mountain,
but the robbers had always managed to drive them off. The Emperor sent for one
of the last remaining Samurai, old Raiko, and said to him:
   "Raiko, you've served me for many years. Do my bidding for one last time.
Go to the mountain at the head of an army and wipe out these bloodthirsty
bandits." Raiko sighed.
   "Your Majesty, if I were young again I'd do it alone. Today I'm too old,
far too old to do that, or to command an army."
   "Must I then," said the Emperor, "submit to the force of these marauding
robbers?" The old Samurai replied:
   "No, I'll go up there with six Samurai like myself."
   "But if they're all as old as you, how can they help you?"
   "Have faith in us!" said Raiko.
   A few days later, the seven Samurai set off on their journey, not with
horses, swords, shields and armour, which they could no longer have worn
anyway, but dressed as humble pilgrims. From the summit, the bandits watched
them come, and their leader said,
   "Who cares about seven beggars. Let them climb up." The seven reached the
cave and Raiko humbly said,
   "Let us come in, it's cold outside. There's a wind blowing and we, as you
can see, are old men. We'll be no trouble to you." The leader of the gang
scornfully replied:
   "Come in, old men, and stay in a corner." And so. the seven pilgrims
huddled in a corner while the bandits ate their meal of food stolen from the
villages nearby.
   Now and again, they threw scraps of food and leftovers to the old men,
saying: "Eat this, and it is much too good for you." A few hours later, Raiko
rose to his feet saying:
   "The wind has dropped. We can go on our way. In thanks. for your
hospitality, we would like to offer you this liqueur, it is sake, rice wine.
Drink our health with it." The robbers needed no second telling. In the blink
of an eye, they had emptied the goatskin bottle Raika held out to them. And in
the blink of an eye they all lay dead, for the sake contained a very potent
poison. And so, the seven Samurai, too old to wield a sword, served the
Emperor for the last time.</p>

                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Once upon a time, in far off Japan, a band of fierce robbers had their hiding place on top of a mountain almost always covered with grey clouds, windswept and battered by storms.
Now and again, they went down the mountain, attacked a village, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could lay hands on and burned it to the ground.
Wherever the robbers passed, there was nothing but smoking ruins, weeping men and women, misery, mournlng and desolation.
The Emperor, worried at this, had sent his soldiers to attack the mountain, but the robbers had always managed to drive them off.
A few days later, the seven Samurai set off on their journey, not with horses, swords, shields and armour, which they could no longer have worn anyway, but dressed as humble pilgrims.
The leader of the gang scornfully replied: "Come in, old men, and stay in a corner."
the seven pilgrims huddled in a corner while the bandits ate their meal of food stolen from the villages nearby.

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">THE ADVENTURES OF TOM THUMB</p>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">   Once upon a time . . . there lived a giant who had quarrelled with a very
greedy wizard over sharing a treasure. After the quarrel, the giant said
menacingly to the wizard:
   "I could crush you under my thumb if I wanted to! Now, get out of my
sight!" The wizard hurried away, but from a safe distance, he hurled his
terrible revenge.
   "Abracadabra! Here I cast this spell! May the son, your wife will shortly
give you, never grow any taller than my own thumb!"
   After Tom Thumb was born, his parents were at their wits' end. They could
never find him, for they could barely see him. They had to speak in whispers
for fear of deafening the little boy. Tom Thumb preferred playing with the
little garden creatures, to the company of parents so different from himself.
He rode piggyback on the snail and danced with the ladybirds. Tiny as he was,
he had great fun in the world of little things.
   But one unlucky day, he went to visit a froggy friend. No sooner had he
scrambled onto a leaf than a large pike swallowed him up. But the pike too was
fated to come to a very bad end. A little later, he took the bait cast by one
of the King's fishermen, and before long, found himself under the cook's knife
in the royal kitchens. And great was everyone's surprise when, out of the
fish's stomach, stepped Tom Thumb, quite alive and little the worse for his
adventure.
   "What am I to do with this tiny lad?" said the cook to himself. Then he had
a brainwave. "He can be a royal pageboy! He's so tiny, I can pop him into the
cake I'm making. When he marches across the bridge, sounding the trumpet
everyone will gasp in wonder!" Never had such a marvel been seen at Court. The
guests clapped excitedly at the cook's skill and the King himself clapped
loudest of all. The King rewarded the clever cook with a bag of gold. Tom
Thumb was even luckier. The cook made him a pageboy, and a pageboy he remained,
enjoying all the honours of his post.
   He had a white mouse for a mount, a gold pin for a sword and he was allowed
to eat the King's food. In exchange, he marched up and down the table at
banquets. He picked his way amongst the plates and glasses amusing the guests
with his trumpet.
   What Tom Thumb didn't know was that he had made an enemy. The cat which,
until Tom's arrival, had been the King's pet, was now forgotten. And, vowing
to have its revenge on the newcomer, it ambushed Tom in the garden. When Tom
saw the cat, he did not run away, as the creature had intended. He whipped out
his gold pin and cried to his white mouse mount:
   "Charge! Charge!" Jabbed by the tiny sword, the cat turned tail and fled.
Since brute force was not the way to revenge, the cat decided to use guile.
Casually pretending to bump into the King as he walked down the staircase, the
cat softly miaowed:
   "Sire! Be on your guard! A plot is being hatched against your life!" And
then he told a dreadful lie. "Tom Thumb is planning to lace your food with
hemlock. I saw him picking the leaves in the garden the other day. heard him
say these very words!"
   Now, the King had once been kept in bed with very bad tummy pains, after
eating too many chernes and he feared the thought of being poisoned, so he
sent for Tom Thumb. The cat provided proof of his words by pulling a hemlock
leaf from under the white mouse's saddle cloth, where he had hidden it
himself.
   Tom Thumb was so amazed, he was at a loss for words to deny what the cat
had said. The King, withiut further ado, had him thrown into prison. And since
he was so tiny, they locked him up in a pendulum clock. The hours passed and
the days too. Tom's only pastime was swinging back and forth, clinging to the
pendulum, util the night when he attracted the attention of a big night moth,
fluttering round the room.
   "Let me out!" cried Tom Thumb, tapping on the glass. As it so happens, the
moth had only just been set free after being a prisoner in a large box, in
which she had taken a nap. So she took pity on Tom Thumb  and released him.
   'll take you to the Butterfly Kingdom, where everyone's tiny like burself.
They'll take care of you there!" And that is what happened. To this day, if
you visit the Butterfly Kingdom, you can ask to see the Butterfly monument
that Tom Thumb built after this amazing adventrure.</p>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</p>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">   Once upon a time . . . as a merchant set off for market, he asked each of
his three daughters what she would like as a present on his return. The first
daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but the third,
whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest of them all, said
to her father:
   "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"
   When the merchant had finished his business, he set off for home. However,
a sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the howling
gale. Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching an inn when
he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of a wood. As he drew
near, he saw that it was a castle, bathed in light.
   "I hope I'll find shelter there for the night," he said to himself. When he
reached the door, he saw it was open, but though he shouted, nobody came to
greet him. Plucking up courage, he went inside, still calling out to attract
attention. On a table in the main hall, a splendid dinner lay already served.
The merchant lingered, still shouting for the owner of the castle. But no one
came, and so the starving merchant sat down to a hearty meal.
   Overcome by curiosity, he ventured upstairs, where the corridor led into
magnificent rooms and halls. A fire crackled in the first room and a soft bed
looked very inviting. It was now late, and the merchant could not resist. He
lay down on the bed and fell fast asleep. When he woke next morning, an
unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his
bedside.
   The merchant had breakfast and after tidying himself up, went downstairs to
thank his generous host. But, as on the evening before, there was nobody in
sight. Shaking his head in wonder at the strangeness of it all, he went
towards the garden where he had left his horse, tethered to a tree. Suddenly,
a large rose bush caught his eye.
   Remembering his promise to Beauty, he bent down to pick a rose. lnstantly,
out of the rose garden, sprang a horrible beast, wearing splendid clothes. Two
bloodshot eyes, gleaming angrily, glared at him and a deep, terrifying voice
growled: "Ungrateful man! I gave you shelter, you ate at my table and slept in
my own bed, but now all the thanks I get is the theft of my favourite flowers!
I shall put you to death for this slight!" Trembling with fear, the merchant
fell on his knees before the Beast.
   "Forgive me! Forgive me! Don't kill me! I'll do anything you say! The rose
wasn't for me, it was for my daughter Beauty. I promised to bring her back a
rose from my journey!" The Beast dropped the paw it had clamped on the unhappy
merchant.
   "I shall spare your life, but on one condition, that you bring me your
daughter!" The terror-stricken merchant, faced with certain death if he did
not obey, promised that he would do so. When he reached home in tears, his
three daughters ran to greet him. After he had told them of his dreadful
adventure, Beauty put his mind at rest immediately.
   "Dear father, I'd do anything for you! Don't worry, you'll be able to keep
your promise and save your life! Take me to the castle. I'll stay there in
your place!" The merchant hugged his daughter.
   "I never did doubt your love for me. For the moment I can only thank you
for saving my life." So Beauty was led to the castle. The Beast, however, had
quite an unexpected greeting for the girl. Instead of menacing doom as it had
done with her father, it was surprisingly pleasant.
   In the beginning, Beauty was frightened of the Beast, and shuddered at the
sight of it. Then she found that, in spite of the monster's awful head, her
horror of it was gradually fading as time went by. She had one of the finest
rooms in the Castle, and sat for hours, embroidering in front of the fire. And
the Beast would sit, for hours on end, only a short distance away, silently
gazing at her. Then it started to say a few kind words, till in the end,
Beauty was amazed to discover that she was actually enjoying its conversation.
The days passed, and Beauty and the Beast became good friends. Then one day,
the Beast asked the girl to be his wife.                  .-~
   Taken by surprise, Beauty did not know what to say. Marry such an ugly
monster? She would rather die! But she did not want to  hurt the feelings of
one who, after all, had been kind to her. And she remembered too that she owed
it her own life as well as her father's.
   "I really can't say yes," she began shakily. "I'd so much like to . . ."
The Beast interrupted her with an abrupt gesture.
   "I quite understand! And I'm not offended by your refusal!" Life went on as
usual, and nothing further was said. One day, the Beast presented Beauty with
a magnificent magic mirror. When Beauty peeped into it, she could see her
family, far away.
   "You won't feel so lonely now," were the words that accompanied the gift.
Beauty stared for hours at her distant family. Then she began to feel worried.
One day, the Beast found her weeping beside the magic mirror.
   "What's wrong?" he asked, kindly as always.
   "My father is gravely ill and close to dying! Oh, how I wish I could see
him again, before it's too late!" But the Beast only shook its head.
   "No! You will never leave this castle!" And off it stalked in a rage.
However, a little later, it returned and spoke solemnly to the girl._
   "If you swear that you will return here in seven days time, I'll let you go
and visit your father!" Beauty threw herself at the Beast's feet in delight.
   "I swear! I swear I will! How kind you are! You've made a loving daughter
so happy!" In reality, the merchant had fallen ill from a broken heart at
knowing his daughter was being kept prisoner. When he embraced her again, he
was soon on the road to recovery. Beauty stayed beside him for hours on end,
describing her life at the Castle, and explaining that the Beast was really
good and kind. The days flashed past, and at last the merchant was able to
leave his bed. He was completely well again. Beauty was happy at last.
However, she had failed to notice that seven days had gone by.
   Then one night she woke from a terrible nightmare. She had dreamt that the
Beast was dying and calling for her, twisting in agony.
   "Come back! Come back to me!" it was pleading. The solem  promise she had
made drove her to leave home immediately.
   "Hurry! Hurry, good horse!" she said, whipping her steed onwards towards
the castle, afraid that she might arrive too late. She rushed up the stairs,
calling, but there was no reply. Her heart in her mouth, Beauty ran into the
garden and there crouched the Beast, its eyes shut, as though dead. Beauty
threw herself at it and hugged it tightly.
   "Don't die! Don't die! I'll marry you . . ." At these words, a miracle took
place. The Beast's ugly snout turned magically into the face of a handsome
young man.
    "How I've been longing for this moment!" he said. "I was suffering in
silence, and couldn't tell my frightful secret. An evil witch turned me into a
monster and only the love of a maiden willing to accept me as I was, could
transform me back into my real self. My dearest! I'll be so happy if you'll
marry me . . ."
   The wedding took place shortly after and, from that day on, the young
Prince would have nothing but roses in his gardens. And that's why, to this
day, the castle is known as the Castle of the Rose.</p>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">THE MONKEY KING</p>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">   Once upon a time , a long time ago, there was a thick jungle where many
kinds of animals lived in harmony together. Their ruler was a wise old lion.
But one sad day, the king died and the animals had to decide who was to be
their new ruler. The dead king had a gold crown, encrusted with precious gems,
and it was decided that all the candidates for the throne were to come forward
and each would try on the crown, and the ruler would be the animal whose head
it fitted. Now, though many tried on the crown, it fitted no one. Some heads
were too big, others too small, a few had horns and some had big ears. The
fact was that the old king's crown did not fit any of the animals. Then a
cheeky monkey snatched up the crown and started to amuse the crowd with clever
tricks. First, he slipped the crown round his waist and whirled it round and
round his middle without letting it fall to the ground. Then he tossed it
higher and higher into the air and caught it as it came down. He then stood on
his head and twirled the crown on the tips of his toes, before jumping to his
feet again and catching it in his hands. All the animals laughed delightedly
at the nimble monkey's skill and clapped in excitement. Pleased at the great
applause, the monkey went on with his show, till the enthusiastic crowd
decided to award him the crown and proclaim him king.
   The only animal to disagree was the fox. "A silly creature like that can't
be our king!" he said. "I'm going to do all I can to make him lose the throne."
   One day, having just managed to avoid a trap that men had set at the edge
of the jungle, the fox took it unseen to the tree where the monkey lived.
Covering the trap with dead leaves, the fox picked a large bunch of bananas
and called up to the monkey: "Sire! Sire! Can you help me? I have some ripe
bananas I'd like to present you with, but I can't climb trees as easily as you
do! Would you please come down and accept my gift?" The unsuspecting monkey
shinned down the tree, and just as he reached for the bananas, the trap
suddenly clamped shut over his legs. The fox began to laugh: "What a foolish
king we have! Fancy falling into a trap for a handful of bananas!" And calling
all the other animals, he went on: "Just look at our sovereign! Isn't he
stupid? He can't even avoid being caught in a trap. If he isn't able to watch
out for himself, how can we expect him to look after us?" All the animals let
themselves be persuaded by the fox's words, and in a twinkling the monkey king
was deprived of the crown. And from that day on, this particular jungle was
the only one whose animals made do without a king.</p>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">      Caryn looked around the store and sighed. Another long,
  slow, boring midnight at Gas'n'More. Being a full-time
  college student made working the graveyard shift necessary,
  but that didn't mean she had to like it. A yawn caught her
  by surprise and she glanced up at the Marlboro clock over
  the wide glass doors. Twenty to three. The after-bar rush
  had tapered off and until about five-thirty or so she
  wouldn't see more than half a dozen people. Then would come
  the factory workers, in for their sandwiches, donuts,
  coffee, smokes, and gas, all of which was ready and waiting.

      She refilled her coffee cup and made another pot, then
  took two No-Doz. She'd had so much caffeine in the last five
  months, since starting midnights, that it barely had any
  effect on her any more other than stopping her yawns. Going
  behind the counter, she set her cup beside the ashtray
  beneath it, lit a Newport, leaned back against the register,
  and gazed out the bank of long glass windows at the big,
  brightly-lit sign out front and gas pumps. No traffic moved
  beyond them. Though the gas station/mini mart was located at
  the junction of two major streets and a freeway, it was
  surprisingly slow at night. Most of the people who came in
  at this time were cops for their free coffee and soda. They
  kept an eye on her, knowing that she was alone all night.
  That wasn't really necessary, she thought. Few people
  stopped in tiny Berkley Park off the interstate since there
  was a rest stop two miles back.

      Actually, Caryn thought as she glanced over at the
  thick textbook on the other side of the U-shaped counter,
  this does work out great if only I could get more sleep, but
  that's what I have to put up with, staying in the dorm and
  sleeping in the afternoon after classes. I get paid to study
  while I'm here, more or less, and I'm carrying a 4.0 grade
  average. Two more years and I'll be home free: a high-paying
  job at the hospital, a car and place of my own... and
  probably a new boyfriend long before all that if Dave
  doesn't quit his shit. But right now I need him to drive me
  back and forth until I can afford to get a car. She felt the
  familiar depression settle over her at the thought of him,
  and smashed out her cigarette roughly.

      A teenage couple came in just then, giggling and
  holding onto each other, both wearing brown and yellow
  jackets from the high school; the same good old Beaumont
  High Caryn had graduated from three years ago herself. These
  kids seemed so young and immature, she thought. Welcoming
  the distraction from her thoughts, she not only waited on
  them but talked with them for a few minutes about the school
  and teachers they knew.

      When they were gone she eyeballed the thick biology
  textbook again. But it was a Friday night and she had the
  next two days off, so why study now? No, she decided, this
  would be a junk night. Leaning over the counter, she grabbed
  a copy of the National Enquirer from the rack on the other
  side of the register and was soon absorbed in other people's
  problems.


      Ryan Callahan was having a rough night. If it wasn't
  bad enough that he'd had a fight with Mike and Anita after
  driving all the way up here to stay with them for the
  weekend, he'd gotten pulled over for speeding. Now, sitting
  on his bike with the cop behind him checking his license, he
  went to light a cigarette and discovered that his box of
  Winstons was empty. It was a great fucking night, all right.

      The cop walked up and handed Ryan's license and
  registration paper over. "You've got a clean record, so I'm
  going to let you off this time. But watch the speeding-
  there's been some bad accidents on this freeway because of
  it."

      Ryan was surprised, and knew how easily he'd gotten
  off. The fake insurance certificate had held up. "Thanks,
  officer, I will."

      But as he pulled off the shoulder and back onto I-24,
  he saw that the cop stayed right behind him. His speedometer
  needle sat steadily at fifty-five until he saw an exit ramp
  ahead, with the name of some town he'd never heard of over
  it, and a brightly-lit gas station sign not far away from
  the freeway. I'll get smokes there, and dodge this cop. He
  headed for the sign, making a complete stop at the end of
  the ramp instead of his usual glance-and-go, but the cop
  still followed as he turned into the gas station.

      Yup, a great fucking night.

      The clerk looked up from behind the counter as the door
  signal burred and said, "Good morning." Ryan grunted and
  walked past her to the coolers, staring in at the frozen
  foods.

      Asshole, Caryn thought, and decided to keep an eye on
  him. With that long hair and torn jeans he looked
  suspicious, and though the store had never been robbed that
  she knew of, there was always the possibility that it could
  happen. Relief flooded through her as she saw the white and
  blue police car pull up outside. The door signaled again,
  and she said, "Hi, Frank, how's your night going?"

      "Not bad. How about you?" Officer Frank Zambone and she
  were friends after both working the graveyard shift for the
  past few months. The other midnight cop, Mike Boujenah, was
  more formal and aware of his duties, but if it was slow
  Frank would stand in the store and talk to her, keeping his
  radio on and listening for the rare call.

      "Oh, slow, as always," she said, flicking her eyes in
  the direction of the suspicious guy, and he nodded slightly.
  Satisfied, Caryn flipped back a couple of pages in the
  tabloid she'd been reading and pointed out a story about
  zombies in South America, which were reportedly heading up
  into the United States. "Would you look at this..."

      Ryan stared in unseeingly at frozen pizzas, burritos,
  and egg rolls, seething in silence. Why didn't that asshole
  cop leave? He and the clerk were laughing over something,
  but he could feel eyes boring into his back. He moved over
  to the next glass door, barely seeing the premade sandwiches
  there, not wanting to leave until after the cop did but
  knowing he looked suspicious being all alone in here with
  the girl cashier. Especially since he'd driven up here
  straight after work at midnight in his grubby work clothes,
  and though he was used to the prejudice anyone on a
  motorcycle got, he didn't like it. But as it sank in what
  he was seeing, he decided to get something to eat so he'd
  look less suspicious and, now that he thought about it, he
  was hungry. If that cop decided to take another good, long
  look at his insurance certificate he might see that the date
  had been whited out and re-typed in, and Ryan couldn't
  afford to have his Harley impounded now, not out in the
  middle of Nowhere, Ohio. He had a couple hundred dollars on
  him, his entire paycheck, but most of it was for his rent
  and not to bail himself out of jail. He grabbed a large
  submarine sandwich and walked across the store to the soda
  coolers, hearing the cop's radio crackle and hoping he'd
  gotten a call and would leave.

      Caryn watched as Frank answered the call, frowning as
  he asked the dispatcher to repeat the code. "What? At the
  graveyard? Ten-four, I'm on my way." He turned to her. "I've
  got to go. There's a disturbance out at Eternal Rest,
  probably some kids goofing around, but the caretaker called
  and said something about graves being dug up so I've got to
  go check it out." Lowering his voice, he added with a glance
  across the store, "Don't hesitate to push that button if he
  starts anything, Caryn."

      "I won't. Hope it's nothing serious," she replied, but
  felt a worm of trepidation coil in her stomach. She simply
  didn't like the look or attitude of the man who was reaching
  into the Pepsi cooler.

      "I'll be back as soon as I can," the cop said as he
  hurried out to his squad car, then took off with his lights
  flashing but the siren off.

      Ryan walked up to the counter and set down his sub, a
  large bag of Doritos, a two-liter of Pepsi, and tossed in a
  Snickers for good measure. The clerk, a small, slender girl
  who almost looked ludicrous in an orange and brown smock two
  sizes too large, smiled at him and said, "Will that be all?"
  But the smile didn't reach her cold dark eyes, and he could
  feel the dislike coming off her in waves. But that was okay,
  because he didn't like her either.

      "Yeah. No, wait, gimme two packs of Winston, box if ya
  have it, too." He pulled out his wallet and threw a ten
  dollar bill on the counter. "That cop a friend of yours?"

      Her fingers danced over the register's keys lightly as
  she answered, "Yeah, he works midnights too. That'll be
  twelve-oh-seven."

      "What?!" Ryan leaned over to see the numbers on the
  register window for himself. "For this? You gotta be
  kidding!"

      She stiffened, angry. Every other person who came in
  the place complained about the prices, but what did they
  expect from a twenty-four-hour convenience store? Here was
  another idiot she'd like to poke in the eye with a
  screwdriver, the only kind of weapon she had in the store.

  "Cigarettes are two bucks a pack, the soda's
  two-twenty-nine, chip's're two-fifty-nine, candy's sixty
  cents, and the sub's two-fifty-nine plus tax."

      Smartass bitch, Ryan thought, annoyed. She was stuffing
  his things in a white plastic sack as he pulled his wallet
  out again and tossed three singles by the ten, grumbling,
  "How much d'ya charge for gas, five bucks a gallon?"

      "Dollar eighty," she said shortly, getting the
  cigarettes from the rack over her head. She wished either
  he'd leave or Frank would come back. He didn't like
  customers smarting off to her and usually said something
  when they did.

      "D'ya have a microwave?" Ryan asked, taking the sub out
  of the bag and breaking the plastic wrap open. "I got a long
  ride tonight and I ain't eating this cold."

      Damn, Caryn thought, but she pointed. "Over there,
  right next to the Frozen Coke machine."

      Later, both of them never forgot that moment, the last
  normal time of their lives before the world irreconcilably
  changed.

      The door burred and Caryn looked over, froze, then
  screamed at the top of her lungs. Startled, Ryan whirled
  around, dropping his submarine, and stared with his mouth
  hanging open.

      A man had walked into the store, and as the door swung
  closed on hydraulic pressure behind him, it had torn off
  half the heel on his bare right foot. The chunk of meat slid
  outside as the door completed its function. But the man
  didn't react, since he had quite obviously been dead for a
  while and didn't feel it. He was dressed in a black suit,
  white shirt, and maroon tie that were liberally caked with
  green slime, and his skin was a pasty greenish-white with
  mold growing here and there. He lurched toward the counter
  but seemed unaware of it and bumped into the magazine rack
  that fronted the register, knocking copies of the National
  Enquirer, Weekly World News, Star, and Globe to the floor.
  As they fell Ryan spotted one headline that caught his eye:
  ZOMBIES REPORTED IN SOUTH AMERICA- PIX INSIDE! South
  America? he thought crazily. They sure migrated fast, 'cause
  this dude is surely dead as dogshit and smells even worse.
  Slipping on the papers, the ghoul tried for the counter
  again and managed to bump a cigarette display aside with one
  stiff, flailing arm. The girl had backed up as far as she
  could go and was flattened against the Lotto machine, hands
  over her mouth, eyes bulging like brown marbles in her face.
  The critter was after her, Ryan realized. It wanted to eat
  her like he was going to eat his sub, only the zombie didn't
  have to nuke his intended meal to warm it up. And once he
  noticed the break in the counter only a foot or so to his
  left he would be able to get his dirt-caked green paws on
  his prey.

      Without thinking about it Ryan reacted. Running around
  the outside of the counter, he swung the heavy bag in his
  hands, the two-liter of soda catching the zombie glancingly
  on the side of the head and knocking him down. The weight of
  the bag made Ryan stagger, and when he turned back, the
  critter was slowly, jerkily getting back up, one side of its
  head looking oddly crushed but still intact, its flat
  colorless eyes now on him. "Fuck!" he said, looking around.
  Again without thinking, acting on sheer primal instinct
  which said __run if you can't fight, __Ryan darted around
  the counter and grabbed the girl by the arm. She was
  wide-eyed and pale with shock, and felt like a moveable doll
  under his hand. "C'mon, we gotta get out of here," he said,
  pushing her toward the windows and urging her to climb the
  counter. There was only one break in it, and the ghoul was
  too close to that for them to be able to use it. He urged
  her over then followed, twisting his ankle in the wooden
  magazine racks that fronted the counter. He sprinted past
  her to the doors, flung one wide, and yelled, "C'mon, you
  goofy bitch! Isn't the smell enough for you?"

      Caryn's eyes were wide and shiny, blank now. She
  followed him docilely out the doors and past the gas pumps,
  under the high roofs on struts over them, and out to the
  street. Ryan paused and looked in both directions, but the
  long black road was dark and deserted. Across from the gas
  station was a cheap strip mall, all the stores dark and
  silent, while to his left was the freeway and on the right,
  a Mexican restaurant. Nothing moved in the eerie dense
  silence. He glanced back over his shoulder and saw the
  zombie still bumping around inside the store, his rakish
  Harley parked just to the right of the doors. The urge to
  get on the bike and just go, hop on that freeway and escape
  this madness, was strong in him yet Ryan couldn't do that.
  His fear of the unknown was greater than what he already
  knew as a threat. He saw little or no choice; whatever was
  happening, it was in both their best interests to go back in
  that store, get rid of the ghoul, and stay put until the
  cops came back or something else happened.

      He grabbed the cashier by the arm again and turned her
  around, not seeing the slack, blank look of shock on her
  face. As they walked back across the parking lot he
  explained what they had to do, looking around to make sure
  more of the rotting fuckers weren't coming at them. As he
  pushed the doors open and shoved her in before him, Ryan
  grimaced at the stench that filled the store, as if hundreds
  of pounds of hamburger had gone rancid. The zombie was on
  the other side of the counter, near the Frozen Coke and
  fountain soda machine, and turned its head to look creakily
  at them as they again climbed behind the counter to relative
  safety.

       Nothing to use as a weapon in sight. Ryan looked
  around behind the counter, glancing at the girl, but she
  looked frozen in shock and didn't move. The zombie, which
  obviously wasn't running on all cylinders, managed to wander
  back their way and bumped straight into the counter again,
  this time knocking the cigarette display off, grunting in a
  flat, desperate tone. "Do you have a knife? Gun? Anything I
  can use to stop that fucker?" Ryan said desperately,
  wondering if the thing would ever figure out how to get
  behind the counter. But even if it didn't it had to go,
  because the putrid, gassy smell was about to make him puke.
  "Bitch, wake up and help me!" he yelled, going over to shake
  her. "Come on, think! That thing sees us as chow and we're
  gonna be its chow if we don't kill it- for good!"

      The zombie bumped the counter again ineffectively, then
  looked down and saw what was stopping it. Gears seemed to
  grind in its rotting brain and it raised one knee, trying to
  climb over it.

      Caryn was thinking of how she often thought of poking
  people in the eye with a screwdriver--usually customers who
  gave her a hard time, like this idiot--since that was the
  only weapon of any kind in the store. You had to stop their
  brains to kill them, she thought dazedly, and managed to
  say, "There's screwdrivers hanging over the sink in the back
  room."

      "C'mon, show me," Ryan turned and vaulted the counter
  beside the Lotto machine, then tugged at her shoulder.
  "Climb over, that'll confuse old deadbrain there long enough
  for us to get them."

      Feeling like she was trapped in someone else's body
  who'd had a massive Novicane shot, Caryn did as he said and
  led him into the back room. Over a stainless steel double
  sink was a rack of screwdrivers ranging from tiny to huge,
  and with an exclamation of triumph Ryan grabbed a
  two-foot-long Phillips. "This'll do. You stay back here and
  lock the door behind me in case it gets me instead of me
  gettin' it."

      "That door doesn't lock," Caryn said woodenly.

      "Then come on! What, you take a 'lude? Wake up, bitch!
  Deal with it! Here, take this. We gotta kill that fucker and
  lock them doors before more come." Ryan thrust a slightly
  smaller straight-slot into her slack hand, which closed over
  the screwdriver mechanically, and went to the doorway to the
  store proper. "Shit. He's corralled now. How we gonna get
  'im?"

      Caryn peered around him hesitantly. The zombie was
  wandering around behind the counter, bumping into it,
  apparently having forgotten how it'd gotten in there in the
  first place. Its blindly waving hands knocked over a rack of
  greeting cards, then bumped the lottery machine and a ticket
  popped out. "That one's probably a winner," Ryan muttered,
  and shook his head. "Well, what d'ya think?"

      The thought of more things like that invading the
  store, trapping them, galvanized Caryn to action, though she
  didn't think there were more, that this was an isolated
  incident. "Guess I'll be bait," she said slowly. "You can
  creep up behind it. How's that?"

      The smile he turned on her surprised Caryn. When he
  wasn't frowning, this was one handsome guy. "Thatta girl.
  Let's do it before I pass out from the smell."

      "No kidding," she agreed, then took a deep breath and a
  better grip on the screwdriver, and walked out into the
  store. "Hey... you," she said hesitantly, cringing when the
  zombie looked over at her and drooled. "C'mon, thing, you
  want me, come and get it." She sidled over to the break in
  the counter, glancing behind her to make sure she had plenty
  of escape room. The front door was only a few feet away and
  she decided to break for that. The idiot biker might think
  there were more, but Caryn doubted it. One zombie was enough
  to stretch her brain to the breaking point and there was no
  way she was going to consider that there might be more
  outside.

      Ryan stayed in the doorway until the thing was out from
  behind the counter, reaching for the girl who was backing
  away at the same rate it came at her. He'd revised his
  opinion of the clerk, seeing that she was showing some balls
  now. When the critter was about two feet in the clear he
  moved, running up behind it and driving the long metal
  screwdriver into the back of its head.

      The zombie's skull simply fell apart, grayish-green
  mush splattering in all directions as the body lost all
  animation and fell down decently--and fully--dead. Both of
  them backed away, Ryan grossed out over the putrid shit that
  had splashed on him, Caryn turning away and retching, but
  she didn't vomit. "Get... rid of that before I puke," she
  said chokingly, and ran into the back room.

      Ryan shrugged. So much for her balls, but they'd been
  there when it mattered. He grabbed one of the zombie's arms
  and pulled, but it came off. "Fuck! I dunno if I can. The
  thing's falling apart like a jigsaw puzzle." But he finally
  thought to grab the shoulders of its suit jacket and managed
  to drag it out the front doors, then paused and looked
  around the silent area. No one or nothing moved, not even a
  car. Maybe I should just go, blow this place. But who knows
  what's going on everywhere else--it could be worse--and if I
  gotta be trapped somewhere during a zombie epidemic, at
  least this place's warm and full of food and beer. Could be
  worse is right.

      He closed the double glass doors and twisted the knob,
  making sure they were locked by jiggling them. "Okay, it's
  gone," he called, and she walked out of the back room with
  her face white as a sheet.

      "Now what do we do?"

      "You think I know? It's probably best if we just sit
  tight and wait and see what's goin' on. Do you have a
  radio?"

      She nodded and went behind the counter, kicking aside
  greeting cards and packs of cigarettes, and pulled a small
  black and silver jambox from beneath the counter. "It's not
  police band, but there should be something about what's
  going on," she said as she set it on the counter and plugged
  it in.

      But only regular music and talking greeted her sweep
  across both AM and FM dials, nothing unusual, but she left
  it on an easy listening station she sometimes listened to,
  low. "Shit, I wonder what's going on. Frank got a call to go
  to the graveyard just before he left."

      "Frank? Oh, you mean the cop. I dunno. Hey, can you
  turn off the sign?" Ryan turned and pointed out the glass
  windows. "That might be why that thing came here. It sure
  couldn't smell us in here."

      "Yeah, all right," she agreed, going into the back
  room. Moments later the big lit sign out by the street went
  dark, then the lights over the gas pumps, and finally the
  pumps themselves. "I can't turn out the lights in here or
  the coolers go, they're all on the same switch. I know
  'cause we had a power outage before and everything went."

      "Hmmn. I see what you're sayin'. We're like a big sign
  sayin' SMORGASBORD HERE to them critters when they see the
  store lit up, even if the sign's off."

      "What do you mean, "them critters"? How can you
  logically think there's more of them out there? And I don't
  even think that was a zombie, maybe some kind of sick joke.
  Just because we saw one, whatever it was, doesn't mean
  there's more."

      Ryan was getting annoyed. "Jesus, what're you, a
  Vulcan? I never heard such cold logic in my life from
  somebody who was so terrified they couldn't move ten minutes
  ago."

      "Like you said, I've got to deal with it," Caryn
  snapped back. "And no, I'm not a Vulcan, I'm a college
  student."

      "Oh god help me, an intellectual," Ryan sighed, and
  turned away. "Another know-it-all."

      "Screw you, buddy!" Caryn snapped. "You don't like it
  here, leave. I sure don't want you here."

      "My name's Ryan, Ryan Callahan," he said, disliking
  being called "buddy".

      "I'm Caryn Jackson," she said, her anger draining out.
  "Okay, so what now? We wait until something happens?"

      "Yeah, I guess so, unless you'd like to take your
  chances in zombieland," he shrugged. "I'm happy here."

      "God, do you have to be such a smartass?" she frowned,
  going to refill her coffee cup. "I wish you would leave,
  'cause I'm already sick of you."

      "Same here."

      Though Caryn didn't want him in the store, she had no
  way to make him leave and hoped that Frank would come back
  by and make him go. She carried her cup of coffee behind the
  counter and as she set it down, her eyes fell on the
  telephone and widened. "The phone! Damn! Why didn't I think
  of it sooner!"

      Ryan had picked up his bag, took out a pack of Winstons
  and his bottle of soda, and was sitting up on the counter
  near the lottery machine, smoking and tapping his ashes on
  the floor. He took a drink from the large bottle, wiped his
  mouth with the back of his hand, belched, and said, "Waddia
  gonna do, call the cops and tell 'em we killed a dead guy?
  They'd sure believe that."

      Hearing a normal dial tone in her ear, Caryn punched in
  the numbers for the dorm. "First I'm calling home, to see if
  anyone's up. Shit. It's busy. Probably Marsha talking to
  Jeff for half the night again." She pressed the cutoff
  button, then glanced over at him. "As a matter of fact,
  that's a good idea. The cops might-"

      Ryan was torn by indecision. On one hand he didn't want
  her to call them, because if they came out again they might
  just check his insurance certificate and that'd be the end
  of his Harley. On the other hand, a gun and authority might
  come in handy if more of those things were wandering around
  out there, which to him there were. As far as Maeve
  Callahan's third son Ryan was concerned, if there was one,
  there was more.


      Caryn dialed the police station, getting a busy signal,
  and tried again. The other end rang, then a tired voice
  said, "Berkely Park Police, Sergeant Boujeneh speaking."

      "Mike? This is Caryn down at the gas station. Has
  anything... unusual... been happening?" "This had better be
  important, Caryn. I've been getting a lot of prank calls
  tonight, I can't contact Frank, and I'm not in the mood for
  any shit."

      Her heart began to pound, the receiver trembling in her
  hand as it shook. "About zombies? It's not a prank, Mike, we
  saw-"

      "Is Frank there with you?" he snapped angrily.

      "No, a customer is staying here because-"

      "That's enough, I'm too busy for this shit." He hung up
  and Caryn stared at the phone in disbelief. "He hung up on
  me! He didn't believe me! He said he's been getting prank
  calls about zombies!"

      "Then there must be more," Ryan said, frowning. "Caryn,
  maybe we should get on my-"

      The sound of squealing tires, clear in the silence,
  made both of them turn toward the windows. Headlights were
  turning into the gas station's dark parking lot, wavering
  and bumping as the car jumped two of the parking blocks, and
  suddenly accelerated across the blacktop toward the
  building. It barely missed a set of gas pumps, and Ryan
  yelled in horror as he saw it heading straight for his
  Harley. But he didn't have time to even move as it crashed
  into his bike and then hit the building, smashing the large
  motorcycle between it and the bricks. The store shook and
  bottles clinked in the cooler, several items falling off the
  shelves, as he sprinted for the door. Forgetting he'd locked
  them, Ryan shook the doors, lost in fury and screaming
  threats at the unseen driver. Just as he unlocked the doors,
  the car's driver's door opened and someone dressed in dark
  clothing fell out onto the blacktop. Caryn, who was behind
  Ryan, saw who it was and screamed, "Frank! Oh, no, Frank!"

      Still furious about his bike but suddenly remembering
  the danger they were in, Ryan calmed himself with a
  stupendous effort and relocked the doors. Staring out, he
  watched as the cop dragged himself up off the ground and
  staggered toward them. Ole Frank the cop had had a run-in
  with a zombie, maybe more than one, it looked like. Blood
  covered his dark blue uniform, turning it black. Big chunks
  of flesh were missing from his neck and arms, his shirt torn
  and hanging in shreds to show raw flesh beneath. He
  staggered toward the doors and collapsed again only a foot
  away, then lifted the top half of his body and stretched one
  arm toward them. Through the glass they could barely hear
  his voice: "Help... me... came to warn you, Caryn...
  things.... zombies..." It trailed off and he fell face-first
  onto the pavement, and didn't move again.

      Ryan suddenly staggered sideways from a shove and fell
  against a stack of soda crates, the bottles clinking. Caryn,
  still screaming, was fumbling with the door lock. "We've got
  to help him!"

      He pushed her away from the doors with less force than
  she'd used on him and held the handles securely as he turned
  to face her. "What, are you nuts? He's dead, and now he's
  gonna turn into one of those things. Looks like he went a
  coupla rounds with a zombie George Foreman. Don't you watch
  movies? Once you're bit by those things and die you turn
  into one of 'em."

      She bit her lip, crossing her arms over her chest and,
  shuddering, looked over his shoulder outside. Then she
  froze, unable to speak. Ryan turned his back to the doors
  and took a couple steps away, frowning, thinking about his
  bike and wondering if the cop at the station would believe
  them now.

      Caryn was staring at a shambling group of zombies
  crossing Pressburg Road toward the gas station, five or six,
  only their forms distinguishable in the dark. But there was
  no doubt that they were zombies; just the way they stumbled
  and lurched gave that away. She would've known something was
  wrong just by the way they were walking, if it could be
  called that. And they were arrowing straight for the store's
  lights at a snail's pace, but it was fast enough for her.

      "Ruh... ruh..." she forced out, and managed to point,
  her mind back to being on Novocaine.

      He looked up, annoyed, then noticed the pallor of her
  face. "Caryn? What's..." he turned and saw them right away.
  "Oh fucking shit. Critter patrol. How thick are those
  doors?"

      "Not thick enough," she managed to say, holding onto
  herself with a dint of will, wanting only to run out the
  back door and never stop running. "Kid broke one of them
  with a skateboard last month."

      "We've got to block them off, then," Ryan said. The
  zombies were just crossing the sidewalk and the lead one was
  stumbling over a concrete parking block into the lot. "We
  might have enough time. What can we use?"

      "I don't know." Caryn's eyes swept over the front of
  the store and she shrugged.

      "Soda crates!" Ryan pointed to the displays of Coke,
  Pepsi, 7-Up, and Faygo stacked up against the front windows
  to the left of the doors, which he'd fallen against when
  she'd shoved him away from the doors. It looked like there'd
  been a recent delivery, since the crates--each containing
  three eight-packs of bottles--were stacked eight and ten
  high. "C'mon, help me. Even if they break the windows it'll
  take 'em a while to get past these."

      As she went to help, Caryn's eyes were on the five
  zombies--skipping over Frank's motionless body--which had
  reached the gas pumps about ten feet from the front of the
  building. None of them seemed to be connected to reality, as
  two were repeatedly bumping against the gas pumps,
  apparently unaware that all they had to do was step around
  them, while another had fallen over one of the concrete
  parking blocks and was still trying to walk face-down on the
  ground. One woman, who was missing her jawbone and had a
  dark, gaping hole below her exposed front teeth, lurched
  steadily toward the lit store with determination, unaware
  that half her coffin was still attached to one of her legs
  and being dragged along behind her. The fifth zombie was
  lurching along in the lead, but stumbling, slowed by a
  missing foot.

      They stacked the soda crates in front of the doors,
  leaving most where they were to protect the windows though
  they were much thicker than the door glass, and built a wall
  about five and a half feet high. Ryan's arms ached and his
  back was sore when they got done, but both felt much safer
  with the crates blocking the doors. As they rested, leaning
  against the crates, something bumped in the night.

      Caryn peered between the bottles, being much shorter
  than the wall. "Here they come."

      Ryan looked over the top, being six-one. One of the
  critters was still bumping against a pump, but the other
  four had achieved their goal and were fumbling around with
  the door handles, stumbling over the cop's body and ignoring
  it. They'd stacked the crates tightly against the doors,
  which opened inward, and since they were locked, they didn't
  bump against the crates, so unless the glass was broken
  there was no danger of them being knocked over. The zombies
  scratched and bumped uselessly against the glass, one of
  them having the intelligence to try and pull on the doors,
  but when that didn't work, it went back to beating its hands
  uselessly on the glass.

      "I think it'll hold," Caryn said with relief. "I don't
  think they're strong enough to break it."

      "Yeah, and the way the one I dragged outside fell apart
  I bet they'd come apart before they were able to break the
  glass," Ryan agreed, grimacing at the memory and glad that
  he'd put the first zombie's body--and parts--on the side of
  the store.

      "Ugh, don't remind me," Caryn shuddered, moving away
  from the barricade. "Now I guess we wait."

      Ryan's stomach growled as he leaned against the crates,
  his back to the thumping zombies. "I'm going to get
  something to eat. Where'd my sub go?"

      "That thing stepped on it, so I threw it away. Get
  another since you did pay for it," she said, going behind
  the counter, but her eyes kept straying to the
  partially-seen forms beyond the glass. "I don't think I
  could eat right now."

       "They're gross, but I'm still hungry and I don't plan
  to starve to death in a store full of food," Ryan said,
  going to the sandwich cooler and taking out a roast beef sub
  that cost a dollar more than the bologna and salami one he'd
  paid for.

      Caryn watched unobtrusively as he heated up the
  submarine and hopped back up on the counter to eat. He'd
  also gotten a large bag of red-hot chips and another, cold,
  bottle of Pepsi from the rack without paying, and she
  decided to keep track of what he ate and charge him for it
  later. There was bound to be rescue, and things would go
  back to normal, so he wasn't going to eat all night for
  free. She tried to turn her attention to a magazine, but it
  was dry and boring and the zombies still bumping against the
  doors and windows outside kept distracting her. A tabloid
  might have kept her interest better than Newsweek, but she'd
  read all of them already.

      "Caryn, have you thought of what we'll do if no one
  comes by morning? Obviously the cop you talked to doesn't
  believe us." Ryan said, wiping his mouth on a piece of paper
  towel and tossing his empty wrapper in the trash. "I mean,
  who knows how many of these things are on the loose, or how
  widespread it is. It can't be happening just around here."

      "I had to do research on American burial traditions for
  my Cultures class last year, and in case you don't know, we
  bury people in two caskets. There's the one you see at a
  funeral, and it's lowered into a cement box that has a heavy
  lid. That's law, Ryan, and everyone who isn't cremated or
  put in a crypt is done like that. So don't think that the
  graveyard's empty, because most of them probably can't get
  past the cement lid on the second casket."

      "How'd you find all that out?" Ryan asked curiously,
  still eating hot chips.

      "Went over to the graveyard and asked the caretaker. He
  even gave me a tour of the place and answered all my
  questions. I got an A+ on that term paper, too." Caryn went
  and poured herself another cup of coffee. When she came
  back, she added, "Even the ones in the crypts can't get out.
  The doors are locked against vandalism, especially around
  this time of the year. Halloween's in two weeks."

      "Yeah, no shit. Now that you mention it..."

      "Get real. What's Halloween got to do with this shit
  going on?"

      "Just think how this looks in some European countries
  where they're still real superstitious. They must-"

      Angrily Caryn interrupted, "For all we know it's a
  local thing. I can't believe the whole world is being
  invaded by killer zombies."

      "I can, 'cause it's better than believing in false
  hopes," he snapped back. "I never think things are going to
  be good 'cause when they aren't, you just got kicked in the
  face again. Look at my fucking bike out there! I just got it
  fixed!"

      Caryn stared at him momentarily. "Jesus, are you ever a
  pessimist. You have control over things that happen to you,
  you know. If you don't put yourself in a position to get-"

      Now he interrupted her. "Oh yeah? How'd I have control
  over the fact that my mother abandoned me and my brothers
  when I was five and I was raised in an orphanage? That was a
  great start, Caryn, believe me, and it hasn't gotten any
  better no matter how hard I've worked at it. So don't spout
  that bullshit about control to me," he finished angrily,
  half-shouting.

      She recoiled and felt tears well up. "I-I'm sorry," she
  said, frowning, trying to stop herself from crying. She'd
  never been able to take a man's angry voice, not after her
  father. It had seemed that he was always yelling at one or
  the other of them. But she lost the fight and before she
  could wipe it away, a single tear coursed from the corner of
  her eye and down her cheek. She ran into the back room,
  where there was a small bathroom, and locked herself in.
  Why'd I have to get locked in here with an uneducated,
  bullheaded biker? Jesus, why not Frank or Jim or even Dave?

      Ryan watched her go with amazement replacing his anger.
  The goofy bitch had been __crying. __Over a stupid argument?
  Of all the people on Earth he could have gotten stuck with
  during an unexpected emergency like this, why her? Sure
  there were worse people--the soon-to-be-a-zombie cop
  would've been--but she wasn't his dream girl, that was for
  sure. Well, at least she wasn't bad to look at. That was
  something. She could have looked like the fat and
  pimple-dotted clerk who worked midnights at the 7-Eleven
  near his house, but at least that woman was an interesting
  conversationalist and didn't treat him like shit because he
  had long hair and rode a bike. Or, even better, he could
  have been home in his comfortable little house... but then
  it had a lot of windows that he would have had to board up,
  and he might have ended up like most people in zombie movies
  he'd seen: ghoul fodder.

      Caryn came out of the back room with her face blotchy
  and eyes red and wouldn't look at him, instead heading back
  to the long wall-length walk-in cooler and disappearing
  inside. A moment later he heard the blowers stop and the
  lights inside went on. He caught glimpses of her in there
  between the rows of shelves and realized with some amazement
  that she was filling the cooler. In his mind she went beyond
  goofy to being an asshole; why work when you didn't have to?
  Even if her bosses survived the zombie epidemic, would they
  care if her work wasn't done? Why did she care?

      Caryn was filling the cooler to have something to do,
  to keep her hands and mind busy, and to get away from Ryan.
  God, how she hated that opinionated, uneducated, pessimistic
  son of a bitch! Uneasily she wondered how long they'd be
  stuck in here together; much longer than morning, which was
  only a few hours away, and they would be on the verge of
  killing each other. Then, with such a shock that she almost
  dropped the six-pack of beer she was about to put up on a
  shelf, Caryn realized that no matter what happened from now
  on, __everything __she knew was irreconcilably changed. Even
  if this was a put-on or a joke or something not real, which
  she was too much of a realist to know better than, the past
  couple of hours had changed her. If someone had walked up to
  her and asked how she'd react in an emergency like this, she
  would have said that she'd be calm, cool, collected, and
  efficient; that how nurses acted and wasn't she training to
  be a nurse? But now she knew different. She had freaked out
  and frozen, completely lost control of herself. She didn't
  see that that didn't matter; she had come through when it
  was needed. Caryn only saw that she had clutched up under
  pressure.

      She unthinkingly shoved the six-pack of Bud Dry onto
  the shelf and moved over to the next, pushing the single
  bottles of beer and wine coolers forward and filling the
  racks from boxes behind her, still lost in thought.

      Ryan, meanwhile, was staring over the wall of soda
  crates at the dark night, past the zombies still worrying
  the doors, to the bulk of the police car and, though he
  couldn't see it, his bike crushed between it and the wall of
  the store. He had put so much work, energy, and money into
  that machine that he couldn't quite believe that it was
  gone, but intellectually he knew it was. Not even the
  handlebars could have survived that collision. His treasured
  Ultraglide was scrap metal.

      This was not the place he wanted to be during what was,
  apparently, a zombie epidemic or whatever you wanted to call
  it. Though only the front wall was glass, and the windows
  three inches thick and pretty much unbreakable by the stupid
  critters, it was hard to defend. And if three or four had
  found them, then there was probably more on the way. They
  had to get out of here, but how?

      Caryn jumped, startled, when Ryan stuck his head in the
  cooler and said, "Where's your car parked? I can't see it
  out there."

      She sighed and stretched, easing her sore back. "I
  don't have one. My boyfriend's been driving me back and
  forth to work, and I live on campus."

      "Oh, that's just fucking great. How are we gonna get
  out of here?" Ryan leaned against the cooler's metal
  doorframe, cool but not cold since she'd had the blowers off
  for at least half an hour.

      "Leave? But why? The cops know we're here, and we've
  got food, heat, and shelter."

      "But it's not safe. Look out front. There's five
  zombies out there now, plus your cop friend when he
  reanimates, and there's bound to be more. If they came here,
  for whatever reason, there's gonna be more. And if they
  break that glass we're fucked."

      She walked down the long, narrow isle toward him and
  Ryan backed out of the cooler. "I don't think they can break
  the glass. Besides, there's a back door, and nothing out
  back but dumpsters. We've got plenty of room to run. I
  think-"

      "And we're still fucked, but fucked on foot. Those
  things are pretty damn stupid, it looks like, but I don't
  think it would take us long to get tired and be ambushed or
  something after running for a couple of hours." Ryan said
  over his shoulder as he walked toward the counter, Caryn
  following after closing the cooler door and restarting the
  blowers without thinking about it.

      "Well, then, you are more than welcome to leave, front
  door or back," Caryn snapped, annoyed at being interrupted.
  "I never wanted you to stay here in the first place."

      Ryan barely heard her. He was standing at the bottle
  crate barricade again, staring past the zombies at the
  police car. A faint plume of exhaust was barely visible
  behind it, and that gave him an idea, whether she wanted to
  come along or not.

      "Are you ready?"

      Caryn took a deep breath and shifted her heavy backpack
  slightly. Though it usually held her textbooks, it now
  contained items that just might insure her and Ryan's
  survival out in zombieland. "No, but I guess I'll have to
  be."

      "Just remember- if anything happens to me, go straight
  to the police station. If that's been... infiltrated...
  well, then, good luck." Ryan stood posed and ready by the
  back door, which was unlocked, his hands on the long metal
  bar.

      "Infiltrated? Where'd you learn a big word like that?"
  Caryn cracked nervously.

      Ryan grinned back at her. "At the movies. C'mon, let's
  do it."

      Before she was ready, he hit the door's bar and was
  out, running. Alarms sounded as the security system was
  breached and Caryn flinched as she followed. The heavy steel
  door grazed her foot as it began to close behind him and she
  stumbled, but recovered quickly and followed Ryan's running
  form around the side of the store, the alarms silencing as
  the door shut behind them. Just as she caught up to him,
  Pressburg Road in sight, he stopped dead and she plowed into
  his back, knocking him over and falling on top of him in a
  sprawling tangle of arms and legs. If they hadn't still been
  on the side of the building that would have been the end of
  them, but the zombies around front couldn't see them yet.

  "You asshole!" he hissed in a loud whisper.

      "Well, you-"

      He twisted around and clapped a hand over her mouth,
  holding the back of her head with the other. They were
  laying on their sides with legs still entangled, facing each
  other, on the cold hard blacktop. "Sssh! Look toward the
  road!"

      Caryn would have bitten his hand if she could have, but
  he had it cupped over her lips. Instead she did as he said,
  craning her neck as his hands loosened... and gasped, but
  didn't scream like she wanted to. In the glow of a
  streetlight near the freeway overpass were zombies, what
  looked like an entire shambling army, coming out from
  beneath the bridge and heading their way. From the graveyard
  on the other side of the freeway, Caryn realized. They were
  less than half a mile away, and coming along slowly... but
  steadily. They could be outrun, but for how long?

      Ryan slowly removed his hands from the back of her
  neck, and mouth, somehow regretting leaving the feel of her
  long, soft, silky hair. Her body, pressed against his from
  chest to foot, was firm yet springy in places... one place,
  in particular. But he forced himself to ignore the feel of
  her breasts against his chest as he whispered, "We have got
  to get out of here, especially now, but be quiet until we're
  both in position. I don't know if they can smell us, but
  we're going to have to take the chance. We'll go ahead with
  the plan... you ready?"

      "As I'll ever be," Caryn whispered back, squirming away
  from him and getting up, unbalanced by her heavy backpack.
  Her body tingled from the feel of his, hard and muscular,
  unlike her boyfriend's, which was soft and paunchy. Ryan got
  up too, absently brushing at the ripped-out knees of his
  jeans, and glanced at her. Caryn nodded and ran out in front
  of the store and across the lot, reaching the parking blocks
  at the end before she stopped. The zombies gathered around
  the doors had just seen her and were turning around slowly,
  creakily. She glanced around quickly, saw that the road was
  clear to the west though eastward came the zombie army from
  the graveyard, and called, "C'mon, you stinking things! You
  want me, come and get me! Dinnertime if you can catch me!"

      Ryan watched from the side of the building. His opinion
  of Caryn Jackson was changing fast. Now that she'd
  apparently recovered from the shock of the situation she was
  not only dealing with it, but dealing with it well. Brave
  girl, he thought, watching from hiding as the critters
  turned and started for her. Instead of turning and running
  like he was sure she wanted to (God knew he did), Caryn held
  her ground, glancing back and forth between the two groups
  of shambling walking dead. She was so unusual, he thought.
  Terrified to the point of catatonia one minute, then in
  charge and taking action. She'd argue with him fiercely, or
  just back down and get upset. There was no telling what
  she'd do next, and if they got out of this Ryan was
  seriously considering asking her out. The fact that she was
  very pretty helped this decision.

      As his thoughts had run on, the zombies had shuffled
  past the police car and were now passing the first set of
  gas pumps in a loose group, one of them walking into a pump
  but this time figuring out how to get around it after a
  moment of creaky thought. They were less than fifteen feet
  from Caryn, who looked ready to vomit or bolt, maybe both,
  as the wind shifted to blow in her face. It was time for
  Ryan to make his move. He braced himself, then darted around
  the side of the building toward the police car, circled it,
  and reached for the open door. But as his hand closed over
  the top of it, another hand--cold and clammy even through
  his white sweat socks--closed around his ankle and he looked
  down to see the cop's open mouth about to close over his
  calf, jeans or no jeans.

      Frank had finally reanimated.

      Ryan jerked his leg away but the hand didn't let go,
  and Frank's teeth clicked together with an audible snap only
  inches from his inteneded place. Lifting his other leg, Ryan
  kicked the cop directly in the face and his head snapped
  back, nose smashing flat, but his head didn't explode into a
  pile of grey stinking mush like he'd thought it might. The
  cop was a lot fresher than the first zombie had been, and
  would take a lot more abuse before being felled, Ryan
  realized with a shudder of terror. He stomped on the cop's
  wrist as his head snaked back to try for another bite and
  the hand let go, Ryan dancing out of his reach without
  thinking; unfortunately, he also moved out of the reach of
  the idling police car.

      "Ryan, hurry up, they're getting close- both ways!"
  Caryn called in desperation. "What's wrong?"

      He turned and looked at her, then back at Frank, who
  was jerkily getting up on his unsteady legs. "Your fucking
  cop friend is after me! I can't get into the car!"

      As Ryan backed up again, Caryn saw Frank rise up from
  the ground on the other side of the police car from her line
  of vision and totter forward like a baby just learning to
  walk, his legs shaky and rubbery as rigor mortis hadn't yet
  set in. The sight of him tore into her soul. "Get in the
  other side!" she yelled, backing up as the lead zombie from
  the group that had been in front of the store reached the
  parking blocks about six feet from her. "Hurry it up, I'm
  running out of room here!"

      Ryan hurried around the car and yanked open the front
  passenger door, then crawled inside and started cursing. A
  computer terminal took up much of the room in the front
  seat, and he had to squirm around it before he could plop
  into the driver's seat. Then he looked up to see Frank's
  vacantly grinning face coming at him from the open
  door--he'd erroneously assumed that Frank would try to
  follow him around the car, but he hadn't--and he screamed as
  he realized that he was trapped, thinking he was dead,
  zombie fodder, and possibly soon to be one of the
  flesh-eating critters himself.

      Then Frank crumpled like a deflated balloon and he
  looked up to see Caryn beyond, her hands flying to her mouth
  and beginning to cry. Looking down, he saw the handle of a
  long screwdriver protuding from the back of the cop's head.
  Thank God she'd remembered it was stuck in her belt, since
  he'd forgotten about his own. "Hurry up and get in," he
  said. "They're following you."

      She stumbled around the police car, hearing the
  driver's door slam shut, and fell into the passenger seat,
  quickly closing her door though she had to fumble to feel
  for the handle through tear-blurred eyes. Shock was again
  taking her to its twilight region, her brain overloaded by
  the horrors of the night. She sat and cried silently, tears
  streaming down her face and not noticing the lumpy backpack
  behind her as Ryan wheeled the police car out of the lot,
  leaving the zombies and the brightly lit store behind.

      Ryan floored the car down the long dark road toward the
  brightly-lit town, vaguely noticing that the sky was
  lightening to his right. It was false dawn, but it meant
  that daylight would come and that thought buoyed his
  spirits, as did their escape from the store. As they swept
  around a tree-lined blind curve and the town sprawled before
  them, he slammed on the brakes as hard as he could and the
  police car slewed sideways, shuddering to a stop with its
  already-crushed reinforced bumper only inches away from the
  two cars smashed together in the middle of the road. "Jesus
  God, what happened here?" he exclaimed, his hands damp with
  persperation on the wheel he clutched tight enough to turn
  his knuckles white.

      Even through her shock Caryn could get an idea of what
   had happened. There were no bodies, but in the glow of a
   nearby streetlight the blood everywhere was quite
   noticeable. It was splashed both inside and outside the two
   cars, and on the ground around them. One of the cars, a
   black late-model Ford Escort, had the driver's door standing
   open and in the gleam of its dome light they saw a single
   severed arm sitting on the bloody seat, an indistinguishable
   tattoo on its wrist. Most likely these two cars had
   approached from opposite ends of the road coming around the
   blind curve and maybe there'd been a zombie standing in the
   middle of the road or several off to the side, just enough
   to distract the drivers so that they collided. And,
   unfortunately, must have gotten out of their cars.

      After staring for a minute, Ryan shifted the car into
   reverse and backed up to a nearby driveway, which led into
   the empty parking lot of one of the many strip malls that
   lined the road into town. He drove through the lot,
   bypassing the accident, and once back on the road beyond it,
   floored the gas again. The brakes now felt rather spongy and
   a small red light had come on over the gas gauge, but there
   was no time to worry about that now.

      Neither spoke as they raced down the dark, silent road,
   the police radio occasionally crackling, but only static
   came through it. Then they swept around a long turn and were
   in the town of Berkley Park proper and as soon as they
   sighted the long main street, Ryan slammed on the brakes
   again, throwing Caryn into the dash but barely noticing or
   that he bounced off the steering wheel himself.

      It was a scene out of the worst nightmare, brightly lit
   by streetlights and their headlights. Zombies shambled here
   and there, some with an obvious purpose in mind (such as the
   one determinedly attacking the front of the 24-hour
   laundrymat while they could hear desparite screams from
   inside) while others simply wandered around blankly,
   apparently having no idea what they were doing. Several were
   gathered around a car in the middle of the street ahead of
   them and in the glare of the police car's bright headlights,
   both Ryan and Caryn could quite clearly see that the zombies
   were hanging inside the car through the open windows and
   chowing happily on whoever had been driving. They were now
   zombie fodder, several of the critters leaning in the
   windows and squabbling weakly over the priveledge of getting
   the freshest food.

      Ryan rolled up his window, glancing over to see that
   the passenger side was already up. Caryn was staring out at
   the carnage with her mouth hanging open, blood trickling
   from one nostril, but obviously she didn't notice she'd been
   hurt. "Hey, wipe your nose, it's bleeding," Ryan said, his
   voice sounding shaky even to himself. "You think there'd be
   anywhere safe?"

      "I... I don't know," Caryn said, absently swiping at
   her nose with her arm and grimacing as she touched the
   bruised member. "All the people are sleeping... sleeping and
   not knowing... Jesus, we have to go to my house! And the
   dorm!"

      "Okay, we can do that," Ryan agreed, half for her peace
   of mind and half to get the gruesome scene before them out
   of his face. He let up on the brake and the red light on the
   dash went out momentarily, then reappeared, glowing like a
   mad dog's eye in the darkness. "Which way?"

      "Go up three streets and turn left," she said,
   squirming around to rid herself of the backpack and looking
   away as they passed the car surrounded by zombies. In the
   rearview Ryan saw that two of them, who hadn't been able to
   get into the group chowing down on the unlucky driver,
   shambled away from the other car and began to follow them,
   arms out and hands grasping at thin air as the police car
   sped away. Free of the pack, Caryn slouched down in her
   seat, not caring to see any more of what the town had
   become.

      Ryan slowed as he approached the corner, swerving to
   avoid a little kid zombie that he saw at the last minute,
   and made the turn a tad too fast, but the well-maintained
   police car let him get away with it. Tires squealing they
   flew around the corner onto a residential street lined with
   elms that stood sentenial along both sides like silent
   warriors who didn't care to get involved in this battle.

      The street was still and silent, mostly dark but for a
  few scattered porch lights and lit windows here and there.
  "Looks pretty quiet. Maybe they haven't gotten this far,"
  Ryan said without thinking, then realized that if the
  critters had gotten to her family he was giving her false
  hope.

      "No such luck. Look there." Caryn pointed as they
  passed a small white house, its porch light burning, and in
  its glow they saw two zombies shambling up the driveway to
  disappear in the darkness on the side of the house. "Oh,
  shit, I hope they're okay! God damn it..."

      This was the first time Ryan had heard her swear and he
  glanced over at her, surprised and realizing how upset and
  tense she was. "How much farther?"

      "Two more blocks. We're about the farthest house out of
  town," she said, nervously staring out the passenger window.
  "That's why I had to stay in the dorm. I couldn't walk all
  that way twice a day back and forth to class."

      Cruising at about twenty-five, they passed the dark
  silent houses, seeing no more zombies and raising Caryn's
  hopes.</p>
                  <h2 class="text-uppercase">Summary</h2>

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">ZOMBIES</p>
                    <p class="item-intro text-muted">Going behind the counter, she set her cup beside the ashtray beneath it, lit a Newport, leaned back against the register, and gazed out the bank of long glass windows at the big, brightly-lit sign out front and gas pumps.
The other midnight cop, Mike Boujenah, was more formal and aware of his duties, but if it was slow Frank would stand in the store and talk to her, keeping his radio on and listening for the rare call.
Satisfied, Caryn flipped back a couple of pages in the tabloid she'd been reading and pointed out a story about zombies in South America, which were reportedly heading up into the United States.
He moved over to the next glass door, barely seeing the premade sandwiches there, not wanting to leave until after the cop did but knowing he looked suspicious being all alone in here with the girl cashier.
If that cop decided to take another good, long look at his insurance certificate he might see that the date had been whited out and re-typed in, and Ryan couldn't afford to have his Harley impounded now, not out in the middle of Nowhere, Ohio.
He grabbed a large submarine sandwich and walked across the store to the soda coolers, hearing the cop's radio crackle and hoping he'd gotten a call and would leave.
She was stuffing his things in a white plastic sack as he pulled his wallet out again and tossed three singles by the ten, grumbling, "How much d'ya charge for gas, five bucks a gallon?"
He was dressed in a black suit, white shirt, and maroon tie that were liberally caked with green slime, and his skin was a pasty greenish-white with mold growing here and there.
He lurched toward the counter but seemed unaware of it and bumped into the magazine rack that fronted the register, knocking copies of the National Enquirer, Weekly World News, Star, and Globe to the floor.
The zombie, which obviously wasn't running on all cylinders, managed to wander back their way and bumped straight into the counter again, this time knocking the cigarette display off, grunting in a flat, desperate tone.
Caryn was thinking of how she often thought of poking people in the eye with a screwdriver--usually customers who gave her a hard time, like this idiot--since that was the only weapon of any kind in the store.
But he finally thought to grab the shoulders of its suit jacket and managed to drag it out the front doors, then paused and looked around the silent area.
Ryan had picked up his bag, took out a pack of Winstons and his bottle of soda, and was sitting up on the counter near the lottery machine, smoking and tapping his ashes on the floor.
He took a drink from the large bottle, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, belched, and said, "Waddia gonna do, call the cops and tell 'em we killed a dead guy?
As she went to help, Caryn's eyes were on the five zombies--skipping over Frank's motionless body--which had reached the gas pumps about ten feet from the front of the building.
None of them seemed to be connected to reality, as two were repeatedly bumping against the gas pumps, apparently unaware that all they had to do was step around them, while another had fallen over one of the concrete parking blocks and was still trying to walk face-down on the ground.
One woman, who was missing her jawbone and had a dark, gaping hole below her exposed front teeth, lurched steadily toward the lit store with determination, unaware that half her coffin was still attached to one of her legs and being dragged along behind her.
"Yeah, and the way the one I dragged outside fell apart I bet they'd come apart before they were able to break the glass," Ryan agreed, grimacing at the memory and glad that he'd put the first zombie's body--and parts--on the side of the store.
"They're gross, but I'm still hungry and I don't plan to starve to death in a store full of food," Ryan said, going to the sandwich cooler and taking out a roast beef sub that cost a dollar more than the bologna and salami one he'd paid for.
She could have looked like the fat and pimple-dotted clerk who worked midnights at the 7-Eleven near his house, but at least that woman was an interesting conversationalist and didn't treat him like shit because he had long hair and rode a bike.
She unthinkingly shoved the six-pack of Bud Dry onto the shelf and moved over to the next, pushing the single bottles of beer and wine coolers forward and filling the racks from boxes behind her, still lost in thought.
Just as she caught up to him, Pressburg Road in sight, he stopped dead and she plowed into his back, knocking him over and falling on top of him in a sprawling tangle of arms and legs.
Instead of turning and running like he was sure she wanted to (God knew he did), Caryn held her ground, glancing back and forth between the two groups of shambling walking dead.
As Ryan backed up again, Caryn saw Frank rise up from the ground on the other side of the police car from her line of vision and totter forward like a baby just learning to walk, his legs shaky and rubbery as rigor mortis hadn't yet set in.
She sat and cried silently, tears streaming down her face and not noticing the lumpy backpack behind her as Ryan wheeled the police car out of the lot, leaving the zombies and the brightly lit store behind.
One of the cars, a black late-model Ford Escort, had the driver's door standing open and in the gleam of its dome light they saw a single severed arm sitting on the bloody seat, an indistinguishable tattoo on its wrist.
After staring for a minute, Ryan shifted the car into reverse and backed up to a nearby driveway, which led into the empty parking lot of one of the many strip malls that lined the road into town.
Zombies shambled here and there, some with an obvious purpose in mind (such as the one determinedly attacking the front of the 24-hour laundrymat while they could hear desparite screams from inside) while others simply wandered around blankly, apparently having no idea what they were doing.
Ryan slowed as he approached the corner, swerving to avoid a little kid zombie that he saw at the last minute, and made the turn a tad too fast, but the well-maintained police car let him get away with it.
Tires squealing they flew around the corner onto a residential street lined with elms that stood sentenial along both sides like silent warriors who didn't care to get involved in this battle.

                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">THE WEEPING PRINCESS</p>
                  <p class="item-intro text-muted">   Once upon a time ,a greedy emperor forced his subjects to pay heavy
taxes. Not only the poor were squeezed, but the nobles in this immense empire
were highly taxed too. At last, tired of being crushed by taxes, the nobles
held a protest meeting. When the emperor heard about this, he took fright for
he feared a rebellion. So he sent out this proclamation to put an end to their
complaints:
   "The nobleman that can make my daughter Sarah smile again, for she's
mourning the loss of her fiance. will never pay taxes again."
   This caused an uproar at the protest meeting. Most of the princes decided
there was no need now to complain, for each was quite sure he would succeed
where others might fail. So off they went to get ready to try and make Sarah
smile. But some of the nobles warned their fellows that, with his words, the
emperor was not really abolishing any taxes at all. From that day on, a long
procession of noble knights trooped from all over the empire to the palace to
try and console the weeping princess.
   The crowds cheered them as they passed, but when they returned with bowed
heads, the same crowds booed and whistled at their failure. The days went by
and the list of defeated knights grew longer . . . Indians, Circassians, Arabs
and Turks . . . from all over the provinces came bold young men, bouncing with
confidence and hope. But the minute the princess set eyes on them, she just
wept and wept. The emperor was delighted, for each failure meant another
taxpayer. Even the common folk seemed contented to see that the rich too did
not always get what they wanted. The only unhappy person among them was Sarah,
who went on weeping.
   One day, a Mongol prince seemed to be on the point of winning a smile. He
thrummed his balalaika for hours, playing first a sad tune, then a more
cheerful one, till he finished by playing a merry jig. The princess sat for
ages staring at him eyed and the onlookers thought she was about to smile.
Instead she burst into floods of tears, to everyone's disappointment. A
Kurdish chief, famed for his humour, who had already kept the court in fits of
laughter, tried to steal a smile from Sarah with his witty remarks. But the
princess's dark eyes filled with tears. Noblemen came from as far away as
Persia, but in vain.
   The only person who had not yet appeared was Omar, the chief of the tiniest
farthest away province. A bright, intelligent young man, he had cleverly got
the better of certain greedy ambitious relatives that tried to take away his
power when he succeeded his uncle as chief. The emperor's messengers had taken
a long time to reach this remote realm, and though Omar set out at once, on
hearing the news, he rode for many days on his fine black horse. Then, one
evening, he reached the palace. When the tired and dusty traveller explained
to the stable boys why he had come, they laughed in scorn. But they had orders
to obey, so they told him to enter.
   "It's late," they said, "and you won't see the princess till tomorrow."
   The emperor's other daughters, however, were soon told of the new arrival.
"He's the most handsome of them all!" exclaimed one of the servants. So
Marika, the emperor's youngest and prettiest daughter, with her sisters,
peeked through a window at the sleeping Omar. Next morning, the emperor
ordered the newcomer to be led before Sarah. The court crowded round to watch.
Unlike all the other suitors, Omar did nothing at all to amuse the princess.
He stared at Sarah without saying a word. And she stared back, with an empty
look on her face. The two young people stared silently at each other. Then
Omar went back to the emperor and said:
   "Sire! Give me your sceptre and I will solve the problem of Sarah."
Surprised at such an odd request, the emperor followed Omar into Sarah's room.
The other princesses clustered round, smiling and admiring the handsome young
man. With a deep bow to Sarah, Omar straightened up and dealt her a blow on
the head with the sceptre. Screams filled the air the emperor threw up hls
arms in rage and his daughters fled in all directions. The guards drew their
swords. Then the whole room stopped in amazement. For, out of Sarah's head,
which had been chopped off by the blow, rolled broken springs and pieces of
metal. The princess that never smiled was a doll! A perfect dolll And nobody
had ever been aware of it except Omar.
   The only princess that couldn't stop laughing was Marika. The emperor
glared at her.
   "Be quiet . . ." he ordered. But he too saw the funny side of it. For the
crafty emperor had been making use of Sarah the doll as a way of guaranteeing
himself a steady flow of taxes from all his subjects. And now, a man more
cunning than himself had exposed his trick. The emperor had a sudden thought:
he would rid himself of the cheeky Marika and gain an astute son-in-law able
to help him hold onto his kingdom.
   "You should be put to death for this insolence," he said, "but I'm going to
spare your life, if you marry my youngest daughter. Of course, you won't need
to pay taxes!" Smiling at a happy Marika, Omar nodded silently. Down in the
depths of his mind he was thinking:
   "One day, dear father-in-law, I'll be sitting on your Imperial throne." And
he was, a few years later.</p>
