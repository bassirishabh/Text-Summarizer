Once upon a time, in far off Japan, a band of fierce robbers had their hiding place on top of a mountain almost always covered with grey clouds, windswept and battered by storms.
Now and again, they went down the mountain, attacked a village, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could lay hands on and burned it to the ground.
Wherever the robbers passed, there was nothing but smoking ruins, weeping men and women, misery, mournlng and desolation.
The Emperor, worried at this, had sent his soldiers to attack the mountain, but the robbers had always managed to drive them off.
A few days later, the seven Samurai set off on their journey, not with horses, swords, shields and armour, which they could no longer have worn anyway, but dressed as humble pilgrims.
The leader of the gang scornfully replied: "Come in, old men, and stay in a corner."
the seven pilgrims huddled in a corner while the bandits ate their meal of food stolen from the villages nearby.
Now and again, they threw scraps of food and leftovers to the old men, saying: "Eat this, and it is much too good for you."
In the blink of an eye, they had emptied the goatskin bottle Raika held out to them.
And in the blink of an eye they all lay dead, for the sake contained a very potent poison.
