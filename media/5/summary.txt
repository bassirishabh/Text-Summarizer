The first daughter wanted a brocade dress, the second a pearl necklace, but the third, whose name was Beauty, the youngest, prettiest and sweetest of them all, said to her father: "All I'd like is a rose you've picked specially for me!"
However, a sudden storm blew up, and his horse could hardly make headway in the howling gale.
Cold and weary, the merchant had lost all hope of reaching an inn when he suddenly noticed a bright light shining in the middle of a wood.

When he woke next morning, an unknown hand had placed a mug of steaming coffee and some fruit by his bedside.
lnstantly, out of the rose garden, sprang a horrible beast, wearing splendid clothes.
Two bloodshot eyes, gleaming angrily, glared at him and a deep, terrifying voice growled: "Ungrateful man!

Beauty stayed beside him for hours on end, describing her life at the Castle, and explaining that the Beast was really good and kind.
Her heart in her mouth, Beauty ran into the garden and there crouched the Beast, its eyes shut, as though dead.
The Beast's ugly snout turned magically into the face of a handsome young man.
An evil witch turned me into a monster and only the love of a maiden willing to accept me as I was, could transform me back into my real self.
